# Telegram bot that gives you the weather.



### Itâ€™s a Telegram bot that asks you to input the city where you live and say you the actual temperature and the overcast.

#

To make this bot I used OpenWeather and Telebot API. Also, to get it always on, I used Heroku.

The link for the bot is here: https://t.me/wetha_notWeather_bot
